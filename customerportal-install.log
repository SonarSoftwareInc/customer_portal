Requesting a certificate for localhost.otlaydev.com

Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: standalone). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: localhost.otlaydev.com
  Type:   dns
  Detail: no valid A records found for localhost.otlaydev.com; no valid AAAA records found for localhost.otlaydev.com

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to download the challenge files from the temporary standalone webserver started by Certbot on port 80. Ensure that the listed domains point to this machine and that it can accept inbound connections from the internet.
